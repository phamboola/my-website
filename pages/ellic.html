        <p>ELLIC is a new trial program that helps preschool Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children build new skills in English and supports the languages and skills that these children and their families already have.

        <p>The apps composed of 4 games each, including a song. The work was dense and went on for a period of 1-2 years.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_ellic/Ellic_characters.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>I worked within a team of 3 designers, one Designer was a First Nations Creative Designer by the name of Keisha Leon to help develop the style and visual language. I really valued their input and direction - it was great to learn so much from them and be able to evolve the style for ELLIC.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_ellic/ellic_activityselect_fruit_03.png" alt="" />
        <p> I pushed on the character design and world building through many of the Keisha's patterns and initial concepts. We were intentional in designing the characters to reflect First Nations backgrounds, being intentional in our range of skin tones and allowing for bold visual colours to reflect the environment and world. I wanted to keep on the beauty that the initial concepts we brought to life.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_ellic/moodboard_ellic.png" alt="" />
        <p>Our inspiration took on the form of magical worlds and childhood memories of goldenbooks and natural brush feel. To help save on drawing effort on backgrounds whilst also being vivid, we undertook a flat background tone look and pushed forward with more Graphic Design inspiration.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_ellic/ellic_deliverybike_PLANTS_skt.png" alt="" />
        <p>One key aspect we wanted to reflect was the cultural aspect. We needed these apps to feel Native Australian. We took great care in reflecting native Australian Fauna and Flora - it was important for us to be authentic to give a great respectful experience that kids can nod to.</p>

        <p>Flow for one of the activities called Animal Mayhem. From our interactions with the SMEs, thought one of the activities in a classroom setting would be beneficial to set in the educational tone. For all of the ELLIC activities, we had to balance the Ipad's capacity of touch and voice interaction. In this activity, kids can interact by using their voice to call out where the animal is and tap to find hiding spots.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_ellic/ellic_concept_ui_bird.png" alt="" />
        <p>As this is a play-based app, the way of working for this is quite different from SASS based apps. We developed this similar to making video games and this allows us to be more creative and playful with the UI design. As part of the UI language, we needed to be very visual-heavy and avoid text where possible due to our audience being quite young and allow for bigger buttons and components.</p>

        <p>Eventually towards the end of the project, I led the Design team to create artwork and prep them for development alongside directing Animators. We went for a 12fps look to feel more paper-like.</p>

        <p>This is one of my proudest works. We hear back everynow and then from the client and they tell us the children's reactions and joy feeling represented and educator's praise at such a delightful app.</p>
