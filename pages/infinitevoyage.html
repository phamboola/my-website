        <p>Kids are finding harder than ever to engage in Maths. Younger children are developing an association with maths performance and anxiety. Using gamification and playful learning - we developed a play-based app to help reduce anxiety around Maths Learning and helping visualise application throught play. We worked with The Victorian Department of Education and Training to create a mobile game that helps kids broaden their mathematical experience in a fun and wholesome manner.
          The game is catered for school children ranging from year 1 to year 12. The app was released for Ipad and Mobile. </p>

        <p>I was a Junior Designer working on this project alongside another 2 other designers, 2 learning designers, a lead game designer, product manager and a couple other developers. We had a lot of activities to design up in accordance to the VCE Maths Curriculm.</p>

        <img src="/img/_iv/iv_rocketboots.jpg" alt="screens showing rocketboots game" />
        <p>For each activity, I partnered with a Learning Designer and a Developer to create scamps, wireframes and usertest out designs before executing final art for team review. In particular, I worked on RocketBoots activity which was about Probability. We were challenged to show the probability as percentages, pie graphs or as fractions. We went through many round of sketches and playtesting to make sure it feels right and reads well.</p>

        <img src="/img/_iv/iv_deepspace.jpg" alt="screen showing deep space explorer" />
        <p>Another game I worked on was designing Deep Space Explorer. The story behind this game was sending a probe into space to gather data, and to do that, players would use graphs to measure speed and distance to safely navigate the probe through the asteroid belt. It was intentional to show the player's previous graph paths in order to help the player learn through trial and error.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_iv/iv_recycle factory.jpg" alt="screen showing recycling factory" />
        <p>Another game I helped design was the Recycle Factory, where players could use rewards from previous games to make new items. Items could be constructed or deconstructed to make materials for higher reward items. For this concept we sublty hinted at Algebra and substitution through the key interaction while also encouraging players to replay previous games to gather more material.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_iv/iv_familyroom.jpg" alt="screen showing multiplayer" />
        <p>Additionally to encourage more positive play at home and for the family, we added multiplayer to the game to encourage all members of the family to engage. From research and testing, we found that kids had a better experience learning Maths concepts if they were playing with others and having fun. As a junior designer, I was proud to have worked on such a massive project that went on for 1.5-2 years.
