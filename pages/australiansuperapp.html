                  <br><br>In 2017, AustralianSuper approached the team at Millipede to develop an all-new mobile experience to capitalise on the growing market for mobile apps and take advantage of the lack of competition in the space.

                  It was a great chance for us to look holistically at how the app has developed, retro our experience working on this, and start up from the ground again to unify and plan out the design approach as part of big upcoming release. Around this time, we relied heavily on our permanent team and I was the sole designer at my workplace.
                  <br><br>We identified key improvement areas based on user feedback: inaccessibility, usability issues, and increasing competition. We then devised a plan to tackle these concerns while preparing for the app refresh.

                  When considering the redesign, I explored several options, including layouts that utilized overflow properties and two-column grids to optimize mobile screens, as well as simpler, one-column designs. After evaluating these options, I recommended the simpler approach for several reasons:

                  <ol>
                    <li>Older users at the time found the Quick Contributions, which had overflow properties, difficult to interact with.</li>
                    <li>The two-column layout posed potential issues, as empty slots would negatively impact the overall appearance, and accommodating additional transaction and fee information could lead to cramped, difficult-to-read text in smaller tiles.</li>
                    <li>I thought about the idea of shuffling cards, a dashboard where you can add more items into it or take items away if needed â€” something modular and interchangeable.</li>
                  </ol>
                  </div>
                  <p class="summary">And thus the simpler, and modular design won out and proceeded to trial and iterate.</p>

                  In collaboration with AustralianSuperâ€™s service design team, we implemented a strategic plan for rolling out new designs over the span of 2 years. Recognizing the potential challenges of introducing significant changes to the user experience, particularly for our older audience, we opted for a gradual approach. 
                  <br><br>This involved testing and updating new designs in the ongoing app maintenance workstream, while concurrently creating a new functionality and readying a complete visual overhaul for a major release in one year.

                  I went through the app and captured the current-state of designs, noting the various font sizes, different colours, spacing definitions. These are the core of what makes up the layout.
                  After that analysis, I went on to establish foundations for those elements. Because of the gradual visual overhaul, redefining the spacing and colour were an easier task compared to the typography sizing, which required more testing.

                  I set up a rule for the use of colours in the appâ€”establishing the foundations and jotting down a 60/30/10 fraction of use adjacent to surface/interactions/accent. The 60/30/10 is a structure that's been taught to me and used in visual development across media so I applied that here.
                  <br><br>Additionally, I intentionally used the <code>dusk</code> tones for interactions as light text on those buttons cleared AAA standards better than it would have on <code>accent</code>.
                  <br><br>To get to the future state, brand palette, we phased out the gradients in the appâ€” keeping the blue tone, as it was close in hue to our intended interaction tone. This allowed the jump to the 2023 design, feel like a better fleshed out upgrade.

After refining the foundations like spacing, typography, and colors, we decided to further improve release 3.7 by updating the icons, completing the set.
