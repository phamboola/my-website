                  Picture a time when you were logging into your browser with your password at least a couple of times a year to check how your Super is going. Sound familiar?
                  <br><br>In 2017, AustralianSuper aimed to capitalize on the growing mobile app market and address the lack of competition in the superannuation space. The goal was to create an additional customer engagement pathway that leads to a more engaging, accessible mobile experience.
                  <br><br>At the time, I was a Junior Designer, bugging away on some other projects and got brought on to help develop the product alongside a team of engineers, <span class="highlight">freelance designers</span> and product managers.

                <p class="summary">Taking a step back, we saw this as an awesome opportunity to reevaluate the app's development, learn from our past experiences, and kick off a fresh design approach for a major upcoming release. 
                  We took user feedback to heart and identified a few key areas that needed some TLC: inaccessibility, usability hiccups, and keeping up with the competition. With a solid plan in place, we were ready to tackle these challenges and give the app the refresh it deserved.
                  <br><br>To steer our work in the right direction, we came up with new design principles that put structure upfront. These guidelines helped us systematically rebuild the app and bring our vision to life.</p>

                  When considering the redesign, I explored several options, including layouts that utilized overflow properties and two-column grids to optimize mobile screens, as well as simpler, one-column designs. After evaluating these options, I recommended the simpler approach for several reasons:
                  <div class="callout">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Older users at the time found the Quick Contributions, which had overflow properties, difficult to interact with.</li>
                    <li>The two-column layout posed potential issues, as empty slots would negatively impact the overall appearance, and accommodating additional transaction and fee information could lead to cramped, difficult-to-read text in smaller tiles.</li>
                    <li>I thought about the idea of shuffling cards, a dashboard where you can add more items into it or take items away if needed â€” something modular and interchangeable.</li>
                  </ol>
                  </div>
                  <p class="summary">And thus the simpler, and modular design won out and proceeded to trial and iterate.</p>

Recognizing the potential challenges of introducing significant changes to the user experience, particularly for our older audience, we opted for a gradual approach. <br><br>This involved testing and updating new designs in the ongoing app maintenance workstream, while concurrently creating a new functionality and readying a complete visual overhaul for a major release in one year. </p>
