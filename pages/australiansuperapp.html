                  <br><br>In 2017, AustralianSuper aimed to capitalize on the growing mobile app market and address the lack of competition in the superannuation space. The goal was to create an additional customer engagement pathway that leads to a more engaging, accessible mobile experience.

                  When considering the redesign, I explored several options, including layouts that utilized overflow properties and two-column grids to optimize mobile screens, as well as simpler, one-column designs.

                  <ol>
                    <li>Older users at the time found the Quick Contributions, which had overflow properties, difficult to interact with.</li>
                    <li>One column layout for lower readability friction â€” anticipating easier tap spacing for older customers.</li>
                    <li>I thought about the idea of shuffling cards, a dashboard where you can add more items into it or take items away if needed â€” something modular and interchangeable.</li>
