        <img src="/img/_volvo/Volvo Show case.jpg" alt="3d representation image of white volvo cars in the aoyama tokyo studio "/>
        <p>I was a Designer working on this project alongside another Designer and the Creative Director, who were based in Tokyo. I was working in the Melbourne team consisting of a developer and game designer. The project was delivered in 6 months.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_photo_lights.jpg" alt="hand holding phone showing aurora borealis lights in the AR space" />
        <p>We were approached with a task of inventing an AR experience that could showcase the latest features of Volvoâ€™s new line of electric cars in a creative and playful way to appeal Volvo as a brand towards Japanese Millenials and Gen-Z. The experience would showcase upon the reopening of the new Volvo Tokyo flagship showroom in Aoyama Tokyo.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_concept_northernlights_01.png" alt="moodboard for the aurora borealis visualisation with chalk and line drawings" />
        <p>We gathered moodboards of any relevant visualisations that would look beautiful in the studio space - we particularly looked at procedural waveform art. One of our concepts took the form of the Northern lights as inspiration for the AR space and experimented with artistic visualisations similar to nordic art, soundwaves and chalk drawings.</p>

        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_concepts_illustrations_01.png" alt="moodboards for the illustration style around line width and tone" />
        <p>I was also responsible for helping design the trivia cards that appear in the AR space. I looked at website illustrations and examples of zines seen in my local japanese-style cafes for inspiration - particularly Brutus and Popeyes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_concepts_illustrations_02.png" alt="sample of three illustration cards seen in the app" />
        <p>The final illustration style I knew had to align with the overall UI style we crafted for the experience while also allowing for playful representations. One of my favourite trivia illustrations was the the infamous Swedish smelly dish. The client loved and gave a laugh at the illustration.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_bev_experience_02.png" alt="sketch of the BEV experience flow" />
        <p>One of my first workshops I did on this project was envisioning what the BEV experience would look like. We did sessions with the client and interally to work around how to best represent an activity that was 'stress-free' and players could learn of Volvo's BEV car benefits. We decided to add in a traditional zen garden experience to match that theme whilse also nodding to stone balancing activities.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_bev_experience_03.png" alt="sketch of the BEV experience flow in a better fidelity" />
        <p>Initially we included more nordic designs on the stones to call back to runes. These were cut eventually as they didn't serve much purpose.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_bev.png" alt="BEV experience being tested in the showroom" />
        <p>We would send over builds to the Tokyo team to test out in the showroom studio. We had a limited number of visits we could test in as the showroom was still being constructed so we had to be aware of the timeline alignments.</p>

      <div class="slide">
        <img src="/img/_volvo/vst_fika_01.png" alt="Fika cafe concepts" />
        <p>Another experience I got the chance to concept up was the Fika Cafe. This is where we wanted to bring out the cultural aspect of Sweden through a gentle relaxing experience over coffee. I had to anticipate the height of the table as well as the width to consider the 3D model design. This was finetuned over visits and usertesting feedback. </p>

        <p>One of the original concepts for the Fika Cafe model. An Elk mascot can be seen enjoying coffee with the players.</p>
