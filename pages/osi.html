        <p>Our Special Island is a play-based app available on the app store. It was initially released as a health initiative study in Tonga - introducing healthy eating concepts and habits through play.</p>

        <p>The problem that arose in Tonga - the introduction of fast foods and snacks led to increased obesity amongst its people. To better educate the younger generation, we were tasked with developing a solution to teach kids the basics of foraging food and cooking through a blend of traditional Tongan and modern ways of cooking.</p>

        <img src="/img/_osi/osi_05.jpg" alt="Activity showcasing gardening" />
        <p>In this gardening activity, players can plant seedlings and garden to gather recipe items. We put in local Tongan plants such as their Betel Spinach, and potato variety and of course coconuts. Coconuts in Tonga are used across a variety of applications such as their husks being used for weaving baskets, and their milk used for their local cuisine. </p>

        <p>I worked as the Lead Designer for this - developing wireframes and keyflows, leading the art direction and world building, finished art and graphic design to assist in the campaign. I worked in a team of 5 people, each of us specialists consisting of a game designer, visual designer, learning designer, developer and animator. </p>

        <img src="/img/_osi/osi_02_pack.jpg" alt="OSI app showing boardgame and mobile app alongside poster designs" />
        <p>We created other learning materials such as a boardgame, worksheets and posters as classroom materials for Tongan educators to use during their classes.</p>

        <p>The app has won awards for Healthy Eating in the Pacific Region and for visual design and storytelling along with initiative.</p>

        <p>After the initiative, a 81% uplift in children in Tonga were able to recognise healthy foods. Furthermore, post-trial 94% listed a healthy food as a favourite, compared to 60% pre-trial. </p>
